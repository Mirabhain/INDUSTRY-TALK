# INDUSTRY-TALK

## What I had gained during the talk :
During Industrial Talk 1, we learned more about ICT Jobs in Clarity Techworks SDN BHD. This discussion covers job scopes, work experience, technology, skills, and advice. In the realm of ICT, effective communication skills are essential. As a professional in ICT jobs, we need to master both verbal and written communication to effectively convey complex technical information. Apart from that, networking is a crucial aspect of enhancing communication skills in ICT. In the rapidly changing world of information and communications technology, students should embrace new technologies, take part in development programs, and create networks with other people. Students may keep informed about the most recent developments in the sector, share ideas, and obtain insightful knowledge. It also provides opportunities to build relationships, which can lead to potential mentorship or even job opportunities. Additionally, it offers chances to form connections that may result in career or mentorship possibilities. I learned how to become an IU/UX designer, one of my dream jobs, from Ms. Syarifah's presentation. She stated that having high creativity, problem-solving abilities, and interpersonal communication skills are essential for being a UI/UX designer. These are the abilities I need to develop for both my studies and my upcoming real-world project.

## Improvement : 
In my point of view, we need an approach to promote introspection through developing action plans. This will direct students as they draft plans of action based on the knowledge they learned from the discussion. We shall as students determine the precise actions, we may take to acquire the abilities and know-how required for an ICT job. This can involve looking for internship opportunities, getting certified, or joining clubs that are relevant to your field.

## Others : 
From this talk, I gained a lot of tips related to my study method and time management that helped me a lot to find a way to be successful like them.
